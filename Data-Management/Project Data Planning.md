# Planning Data Management for a Project

Before beginning your research, you need to set up a data management plan to 1) reduce errors and limit data loss, 2) streamline your data collection with standardization and potentially automation, 3) use documentation to promote reproducibility, and 4) meet your funder/publisher requirements.

1. Make a list of the data you’ll collect/generate and the types of analyses that will be performed on them. This will allow you to make a plan for establishing a folder organization scheme to include everything that will be done and as well as creating a file naming system that everyone working on the project can adhere to and understand. This should be done with the full group working on the project.
2. Determine data storage and back-up locations.
  - To do this effectively, you must have an estimate for total storage you’ll need. Pick a storage location with plenty of space for your project and that can be accessed by all group members that will need to work with the data. See theData Management Policy for potential storage options.
  - Back-ups are essential to minimize the risk of data loss. Automated back-ups protect work you do each day to ensure nothing is lost in case of hardware failure and also for accidents like overwriting files.
    - Use the Data Back-up 3-2-1 strategy: Have at least 3 copies of your data. Two of the copies should be local but on different mediums/devices, and one copy should be off-site. This should especially be utilized for the raw data that are irreplaceable.
3. Document your Data Management Plan. Write down the file naming convention, folder organization, storage and back-up location, and who has access to what data. Keep this in a location that everyone who needs access to the data can reference.
4. Create a Data File Inventory. This tracks every data file and is particularly useful for work done by a large group. It can be done in a spreadsheet or plain text document.
  - Gives a centralized overview of your data
    - File names and locations
    - Persons responsible
    - Status and dates
    - Content description
    - Summary metrics
    - Relations and usage
  - Potential Headers for an Inventory
    - File Name
    - File Location
    - Project
    - Created By
    - Managed By
    - Date Created
    - Date Updated
    - Update Comment
    - Status (froze, error free, ready for review, contains errors)
    - Status comment
    - Derived from
5. Create thorough documentation in README files. See the “Documenting Data” section for more information.
6. Choose where you’ll publish your datasets. There are many open and subject-specific data repositories. Choosing one can be difficult but look for a repository that is known to be stable, transparent, and secure. These sites should provide an enduring location for others to find your data with a permanent url (DOI) and citation. See the [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org/) (re3data) to select one that is appropriate for your data. This can be an open repository or a data-specific one.
