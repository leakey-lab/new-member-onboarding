### Leakey Lab Shared Storage
1. Box ([https://uofi.box.com/s/y7d9vdfhtrbyj5o121eo7eovpq98v7yb](https://uofi.box.com/s/y7d9vdfhtrbyj5o121eo7eovpq98v7yb))
    1. This area is shared by all graduate students and postdocs working on Leakey Lab projects
    2. Folders:
        1. Grant: a directory is created for each funded proposal
            1. A folder is then created for each project funded under that grant. In the project folder, each researcher will have their own folder to store what they are working on.
            2. These folders should be used to store processed data, code, documentation, manuscripts, and presentations
        2. RAW Data:
            1. All raw, unprocessed data files should be placed here immediately upon receiving them. This will be one of the three locations where raw data should be stored.
            2. Organized by grant, project, and researcher like the outer folders.
            3. All data should be accompanied by a README file. Use the [Dataset Readme Template](https://github.com/leakey-lab/new-member-onboarding/blob/main/Data-Management/README_DATASET_template.txt) to model your version.
        3. Published Data:
            1. All data used in published manuscripts should be deposited here as well as being published in a location like the Illinois Data Bank.
            2. Organize in folders first by year, then manuscript name.
            3. All data should be accompanied by the README file that was published with the dataset, and a copy of the manuscript.
2. File Server (*/file-server/themes/GEGC/LeakeyLab*)
    1. This space is shared by all graduate students and postdocs working on Leakey Lab projects.
    2. Folders:
        1. Grant: a directory is created for each funded proposal
            1. A folder is created for each project funded under that grant. In the project folder, each researcher will have their own folder to store what they are working on.
            2. These folders should be used to store processed data, code, documentation, manuscripts, and presentations
*Raw and published data can be located here, but in your own folder. Copies must be on Box*
