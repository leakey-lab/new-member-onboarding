# Data Management Best Practices

## File Naming Conventions

Naming your files in with a consistent structure will make your files easier to find in the future as well as making them easier to share with labmates and other researchers. Before collecting any data, file naming conventions should be developed and documented. This is best done by everyone in the lab who works with the same type of data to use a consistent naming structure, which makes collaboration more straightforward.

Avoid blank spaces and special characters (' '!@#$%^&") in your filenames because computer interpretation can be problematic. Also, use a common letter case pattern, like Kebab-case (a – between each word), CamelCase (Uppercase first letters for each word), or Snake_case (a _ between each word).

*Potential Details to Include:*
- Date of Creation/Collection (YYYY-MM-DD format recommended)
- Project Lead/File Creator’s Last Name or Initials
- Short Description
- Location Data Collected
- Project Name or ID Number
- Sample Type
- Analysis Stage
- Session/Group Identifier
- Source
- Version Number

*Examples:*
- 20190608_EnergyFarm_SorghumTrial_SoilTemperature.csv
- MassSpec-Rt-Smith-20201110.tif

## Folder Organization

A consistent and easy to navigate file structure ensures that files are easy to find and easy to share in the future. Organizing the material emphasizes the links between various files. Like a naming convention, this should be a joint decision by everyone in the group who works on the project. It makes it easier to share files with your colleagues.

Folder organization should be tailored to your project. Use consistent naming conventions, and create a text file in each folder describing the type of data within and the naming schema used.

*Types of Organization:*
- By File Type
  - Dataset.A
    - Data
      - Processed
      - Raw
    - Results
      - Figure.1
      - Figure.2
      - Models
    - Readme.txt
- By Analysis Type
  - Dataset.B
    - Figure.1
      - Data
      - Results
    - Figure.2
      - Data
      - Results
    - Table.1
      - Data
      - Results
    - Readme.txt
- By Time Period
  - Dataset.D
    - YYYY-MM-01
    - YYYY-MM-02
    - YYYY-MM-03
