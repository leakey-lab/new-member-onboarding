## Shared Lab Data Resources
### Leakey Lab Box Folder

All members of the Leakey Lab are added to a shared [Box Folder](https://uofi.box.com/s/y7d9vdfhtrbyj5o121eo7eovpq98v7yb). This space is for storing and sharing: 
- all raw datasets 
- any analyses or processed data  
- all published manuscripts
- all data supporting published manuscripts
- all presentations/posters given

### Leakey Lab File Server 

All members of the Leakey Lab can use the shared space in the GEGC theme folder (/file-server/themes/GEGC/LeakeyLab). This space is for storing and sharing:
- any analyses or processed data

### Leakey Lab GitHub

All members of the Leakey Lab should have a GitHub account and join the [Leakey Lab Organization](https://github.com/leakey-lab). This space will be used for: 
- Sharing and documenting code for analyzing specific data types
- Making code supporting publications available publicly
- Sharing protocols within the team

## Data Management Planning

1. All researchers joining the lab need to develop a data management plan for their project. Researchers should:
    - Estimate how much data will be collected/generated 
    - Determine what processing resources will be needed 
    - Determine who else will need access to the data/scripts 
2. Once these questions are answered, appropriate storage locations can be decided.
    - Researchers should attempt to follow the 3-2-1 rule for data storage.
      - 3 copies of the data, one primary and two back-ups. This refers especially to the raw (beginning) data that can not be recovered if lost, but code, some processed data, presentations, posters and manuscripts should be considered in the same way if you would need to redo efforts to re-obtain the files.
      - 2 copies of the data should be on different types of media. For instance, 2 could be in the cloud (e.g. Box and Google Drive) and 1 could be on a hard drive or server (e.g. file server).
      - 1 copy should be located offsite. This is harder to accomplish, but a a
    - If collaboration within the lab is necessary, one of the [shared data resources](#shared-lab-data-resources) should be used. Embed your directory under the grant/project that you'll be working on.
3. Develop an organizational scheme include folder structure and file naming convention. Examples of different types of these can be found on the [Data Management Best Practices Page](#Data-Management/Best Practices.md)
4. Develop documentation or a README file to describe the data. It should explain how and when the data were collected, instrumentation used for collection, where the measurements were taken, spatial/temporal resolution, and who collected the data. 
5. Using a log to document the steps in the research process should also be used. This is used to track what scripts are used for each step and how they are altered throughout the process. This can when writing the method section of a manuscript and for when any changes need to occur.

## Data Sharing Requirements

### Raw Data
All raw data collected belongs to the Leakey Lab and the agency funding your research. To protect this investment, researchers are required to upload all raw datasets to the shared Leakey Lab Box folder. *While this data will be shared with all researchers in the lab, no researcher should use your data without direct communication with the researcher who uploads it and Andrew Leakey until the dataset and accompanying manuscript has been published.*
1. Use a descriptive, standardized name for each file. See the [Data Management Best Practices Page](Data-Management/Best Practices.md) for examples. 
2. Organize the files in a folder structure that makes sense. This could potentially be by date, locations, or data types. The file structure and file name together should make it clear as to what data is in the file.
3. Create a folder in the Raw Data directory in the [Leakey Lab Box folder](https://uofi.box.com/s/y7d9vdfhtrbyj5o121eo7eovpq98v7yb). The folder should be under the grant, project, and researcher's name. Create any of these folders if necessary.
4. For each dataset downloaded, create a [README File](Data-Management/README_DATASET_template.txt) to upload with the dataset. Please take time to describe the dataset, so it is useful to both you and later researchers in the future. 

### Published Data
All datasets supporting manuscripts should be published either via a subject-related repository (search for one using the [Registry of Research Data Repositories](https://www.re3data.org/)), the [Illinois Data Bank](https://databank.illinois.edu/), or another repository that will provide you with a digital object identifier (DOI).
1. While preparing the manuscript, prepare your dataset to be published as well as a README file.
2. Create a folder in the Published Data folder in the [Leakey Lab Box folder](https://uofi.box.com/s/y7d9vdfhtrbyj5o121eo7eovpq98v7yb). A folder for each year of publication should be in the folder. Please create if it's not already there. Create a folder for your publication data named for the name of the dataset. 
3. Place the organized dataset, the README file, and pdfs of the related publications in the folder.
