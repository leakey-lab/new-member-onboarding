# Leakey Lab Data 

## Shared Lab Data Resources
### Leakey Lab Box Folder

All members of the Leakey Lab are added to a shared Box Folder. This space is for storing and sharing: 
- all raw datasets 
- any analyses or processed data  
- all published manuscripts
- all data supporting published manuscripts
- all presentations/posters given

### Leakey Lab File Server 

All members of the Leakey Lab can use the shared space in the GEGC theme folder. This space is for storing and sharing:
- any analyses or processed data

## Data Management Requirements ##
1. All researchers joining the lab need to develop a data management plan for their project. Researchers should:
    - Estimate how much data will be collected/generated 
    - Determine what processing resources will be needed 
    - Determine who else will need access to the data/scripts 
2. Once these questions are answered, appropriate storage locations can be decided.
    - Researchers should attempt to follow the 3-2-1 rule for data storage.
      - 3 copies of the data, one primary and two back-ups. This refers especially to the raw (beginning) dataset that can not be recovered if lost.
      - 2 copies of the data should be on different types of media. For instance, 2 could be in the cloud (e.g. Box and Google Drive) and 1 could be on a hard drive or server (e.g. file server).
      - 1 copy should be located offsite. This is harder to accomplish, but a a
    - If collaboration within the lab is necessary, one of the [shared data resources](# Shared Lab Data Resources)
