# Leakey Lab Data 

1. [Shared Data Resources](#shared-lab-data-resources)

## Shared Lab Data Resources
### Leakey Lab Box Folder

All members of the Leakey Lab are added to a shared Box Folder. This space is for storing and sharing: 
- all raw datasets 
- any analyses or processed data  
- all published manuscripts
- all data supporting published manuscripts
- all presentations/posters given

### Leakey Lab File Server 

All members of the Leakey Lab can use the shared space in the GEGC theme folder. This space is for storing and sharing:
- any analyses or processed data

## Data Management Planning
1. All researchers joining the lab need to develop a data management plan for their project. Researchers should:
    - Estimate how much data will be collected/generated 
    - Determine what processing resources will be needed 
    - Determine who else will need access to the data/scripts 
2. Once these questions are answered, appropriate storage locations can be decided.
    - Researchers should attempt to follow the 3-2-1 rule for data storage.
      - 3 copies of the data, one primary and two back-ups. This refers especially to the raw (beginning) data that can not be recovered if lost, but code, some processed data, presentations, posters and manuscripts should be considered in the same way if you would need to redo efforts to re-obtain the files.
      - 2 copies of the data should be on different types of media. For instance, 2 could be in the cloud (e.g. Box and Google Drive) and 1 could be on a hard drive or server (e.g. file server).
      - 1 copy should be located offsite. This is harder to accomplish, but a a
    - If collaboration within the lab is necessary, one of the [shared data resources](#shared-lab-data-resources) should be used. Embed your directory under the grant/project that you'll be working on.
3. Develop an organizational scheme include folder structure and file naming convention. Examples of different types of these can be found on the [Data Management Best Practices Page](Data-Management/Best Practices.md)

## Data Sharing Requirements
All raw data collected belongs to the Leakey Lab and the agency funding your research. To protect this investment, researchers are required to upload all raw datasets to the shared Leakey Lab Box folder.
